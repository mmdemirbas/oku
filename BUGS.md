# BUGS.md — open defects

A log of confirmed defects, newest first. One entry per defect.

Each entry carries: **symptom**, **minimal reproduction**, **expected vs
actual**, **where the failure was localised**, and — separately — what was
*observed* versus what was *inferred from reading source*. Do not collapse
those two: a mechanism read out of code is a hypothesis until it is executed.

Close an entry by deleting it once the fix is committed. The commit message
carries the record, including what was measured before and after.

No open defects.

The three that were here — a page-adjacent image reaching neither dist output,
an HTML island cut at its first blank line, and code in an island that could
not both render and copy — are fixed in kit `2026-08-20-r44`. Each reproduction
now runs green as a test: `test_build_carries_assets.py`,
`browser/test_image_delivery.py`, and
`browser/test_html_island_spans_blank_lines.py`.

One thing recorded here was NOT a defect. A page named `index.md` in a tree
whose `index.html` came from `oku init` builds correctly, in either order —
`oku build` carries the page body into `dist/standalone/index.html` and
`dist/site/index.json` both times, measured on r44. The trap was in reading
the artifact, not in writing it.
